DONE #0 Hide Prelude.(.) and define `a . b = b a` so that `stack.top` reads
   logically (HUGELY CONTROVERSIAL?)

DONE #1 Make Recipe a Monad so we can use `do` notation for sequences

#3 Convert to use StableName and get rid of the horrible HORRIBLE
   fragile hack that forces the use of -fno-cse -fno-full-laziness

#5 Unify the Bit/[Bit]/Word n mess and replace with a single notion
   "Word n", thus <&> operates on Word n rather than Bit and there's
   no more "andG" (eventually).

#5.1 Create a new `vat` which gives Word N1 rather than Bit
#5.2 Rewrite some examples.

#999.999 Give better syntax/names to everything
